# Facial emotion recognition in the wild: an experimental framework and a comprehensive evaluation

Emotion recognition from face images is a challenging task that gained interest in recent years for its applications to business intelligence and social robotics.

Existing emotion recognition systems evaluate their accuracy on common benchmark datasets that do not extensively cover possible variations that face images undergo in real environments. Following on investigations carried out in the field of object recognition, weevaluated the robustness of state-of-the-art models for emotion recognition when their input is subjected to alterations caused by factors present in real-world scenarios.
